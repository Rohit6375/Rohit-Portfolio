        I specialize in <span className='font-bold text-white'>React and modern JavaScript</span>, leveraging best practices to create scalable and maintainable solutions. My experience spans working on diverse projects during a full-stack internship and through self-guided learning — including a real-time food delivery app. I’ve gained hands-on experience with tools like <span className='font-body text-white'>Tailwind CSS, REST APIs, and Git</span>, and I focus on building responsive, user-centric interfaces that perform well across devices.
